**Project Development Progress Report**

**Introduction**

This document delves into our choices regarding social media selection, the establishment of the project's folder structure, and the initial configuration steps, illustrating our strategic method in integrating these technologies into our project and paving the way for future developments. Notably, we've made a definitive choice on which application's API to utilize, decisively established and initialized the project's directory layout, obtained an API key for Reddit, and designed a logo for our project, enhancing our brand identity.

**Choosing the Social Media Application**

**X - (Twitter)** → Reached out and waiting for a reply.

**Instagram** →  Considered as a potential choice. However, captions are mostly related to images, and since our focus isn't on processing images, this option was eliminated.

**Reddit** → We chose to proceed with Reddit after thoroughly considering its content variety and alignment with our project goals.

Utilizing Reddit's API

**Exploring API Tools:**

Discovered PRAW, a Python wrapper tailored for Reddit's API, perfectly aligning with our objectives. [PRAW Documentation](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), provides crucial guidance on usage. Also we considered Reddit's API as an alternative. Opted for PRAW to better meet our project's needs.

**Project Kick-off**

Established an Outlook account (<cmpe492@hotmail.com>) for all project-related communications, other than Discord.

Created a Reddit account linked to this email for API interactions.

**Structuring the Project**

Initiated a logical folder structure to efficiently manage code and resources, adaptable as our project evolves.




**Brand Identity**

Developed a unique logo for our project, establishing a visual identity that reflects our mission and values.

**Moving Forward**

Awaiting a response from Twitter for additional API integration possibilities.

Planning to delve deeper into PRAW's functionalities for seamless project integration.

Aiming for ongoing refinement of our project's structure to suit evolving development needs.

**Conclusion**

This document encapsulates the deliberate decisions and foundational steps we've undertaken in integrating social media APIs into our project. With a particular focus on leveraging Reddit for its content diversity and the practicality of the PRAW wrapper, coupled with the creation of a distinctive logo, we've laid down a solid groundwork to build upon, marking a significant stride in our project's journey.
